## Description

My grandfather left a weird device behind, all I could tell is that it seems to 
index stuff and the word "Tallon". Next to it there was a paper with some sort 
of a code written.

## Deploy notes

-show the following string: '7-1 4-1 4-2 8-1 1 1 1 9 1 8-1 7-1 10 5-2 1 1 1 2 7-1 5-2 1 1 1 5-1 8-2 1 5-2

## Solution

Search online for 'Index cards Tallon' to find an image like the Tallon.png in 
solution folder.

Two options from there: 

- By hand when looking at the image
- Implement a simple dictionary like converter to quickly get the flag(like the
solve.py file)
