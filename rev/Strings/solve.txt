The flag is a string split up into 7 separately initalized strings, lengths of 3 each except the last
There is no call reference to the string but it can be found being pushed onto the stack right before the first printf
To prevent skids from just using `strings` on the file, the lengths are all less than 4, the minimum string length that `strings` prints by default, though using `strings -3` would have found all the strings except the last (which could have been inferred)
