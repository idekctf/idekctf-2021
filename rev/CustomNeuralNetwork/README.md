## Description

This CNN is very very good at recognising the flag, be it with an "artistic" flare.

**Note**: The net think capital letters are the best, but I prefer lower case, so please submit the flag in all lowercase. `idek{[a-z_]+}`

## Deploy notes

- downloadable `flag_model.h5`
- downloadable `cnn_flag_checker.py`
